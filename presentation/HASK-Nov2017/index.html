						## Intro
						<img src="images/GurjeetVSRouter.png" style="width: 800px">

						Note: This is a quick-ish talk on a simple project that pivoted a bit. Like browsing Imgur
						it just kept going. Had this AP Router, and I thought I had complete control over it. 
						I had altered the administrative username and password, modified the firewall rules to be restrictive.
						Had to call to get some help on configuring it at one point, and was told thye could reset it to 'factory'
						defaults remotely. Fascinated I wondered how. This is how I learned about the existence of TR-069 (another talk).

						## The story so far
						<img src="images/Actiontec-Front.jpg" style="width: 600px">

						Note: 	Not liking this at all, I had decided to build my own router on a *nix box, but had to 
						learn how the router was operated. We had IPTV through the device and multicast routing via VLAN 
						with priority tagging wasn't an easy thing to accomplish. 
						Putting this project aside while I learned more about what options were available to me, 
						I decided I needed more information on the configuration. This is when I went looking for the firmware.

						## Moar Intro Story!
						<img src="images/Actiontec-Inside.jpg" style="width: 600px">
						
						Note: It seems Actiontec has issues with complying with GPL rules, so I decided I had no choice. 
						Time to break into the router. This is the documentation of the work and what has been discovered so far. 

						--
						
						## Remember TR-069?
						<img src="images/avg-vforvendetta.ans.png" style="width: 200px">

						Note: When I asked the tech HOW they were able to reset my 'locked down' AP router, 
						they said, "uhh, I don't think I can tell you that sir" as if it was a secret.

						## O RLY?!

                        ---
					
						## Project Replace Router

						Note: Short story, so far its not moved forward; IGMP Multicast routing with priority vlan settings is hard
						on pfSense (not implemented yet) or OpenBSD pf/igmp routing. You can replace with an ASUS (jason keirstead)

						### Now what?

						Note: Getting the firmware would be one thing, but i was more interested in the ISP configuration.
						Tried snmpwalk (worked with eastlink), no go. Nmap didn't show much. Lets get dirty. Don't use my own
						router. Yay Kijiji!

						## Whats available to me?
						/dev/ttys0 is a great resource
						http://www.devttys0.com/

						<img src="images/Actiontec-Serial-JTAG-label.jpg" style="width: 600px">

						Note: Once obtained, need to identify the chips and ports that are available to you. devttys0 is a great
						resource on what do to an how to do this. Also DD-WRT/OpenWRT were helpful. After identifing serial ports, 
						going to WRT sites and saw specs on manufacturer APS that the layout was the same across moels. Assuming they
						did the "if it ain broke, don't fix/change it" plan, got me a serial connection. JTAG to explore later.

						---

						## UART connection
						<img src="images/OSEPP-FTDI.jpg" style="width: 700px">

						Note: Once you ID the UART ports on the device, connect to hacking device of choice. You'll need
						to be able to establish a serial connection. If you don't have an RS-232 port an FTDI based
						USB-to-Serial converter device will work best. Or an Rpi works great too.
